### Translator with Transformer Architecture [(Project link)](https://github.com/kalyan926/Translator)

- English to Telugu translator with complete **Transformer architecture** built from scratch using **keras subclassing APIs** for flexibility and control over the architecture's design and customization.
- Trained the model with custom training loop and scheduled learning rate for faster convergence. Used **kerastuner** library for best selection among the range of hyperparameter models using custom metric. The model's translation quality is evaluated using **BLEU** score metric.
- The Transformer architecture with multihead attention greatly improves the model's capability to manage long-term dependencies between words, offering improved contextual representation, capturing subtle nuances and semantic relationships crucial for translation and evaluated through **BLEU** score testing.

  
### Fine Tuning LLAMA2 Using QLORA [(Project link)](https://github.com/kalyan926/FineTuning-using-QLORA)

- Finetuning the base **LLAMA2-7b** using **QLORA** method with significantly fewer trainable parameters(<1%) to achieve faster training on limited hardware resources (single GPU). Finetuning is done with python code datasets for chat completions of coding related tasks.
- The base LLAMA2 model is quantized to 4 bit Normal Float using bitsandbytes library and then added the low rank adapter(**LORA**) layer to linear layers of model using **PEFT** library for fine tuning. Effectiveness of model is evaluated using **CODEBLEU** metric.
- Fine-tuning with the QLORA technique achieved 90% performance of the original full-precision trained model, using limited resources (a single GPU).

### üß† Multiagent AI Assistant [(Project link)](https://github.com/kalyan926/MultiAgent_AI_Assistant)

- Built a multi-agent system for intelligent task completion using **LANGCHAIN** and **OpenAI APIs** to leverage GPT-4 for improving productivity and efficiency of users.
- Implemented 4 specialized agents: **Task Planner**, **Task Executor**, **Evaluator** and **Feedback Agent** each designated for specific tasks and these agents are interconnected to form 
  a graph structure for facilitating seamless communication and task execution. 
- Agents are integrated with **Memory** for storing intermediate results and context, **RAG** to filter and provide only relevant information to the LLM's from the tools output, preventing **hallucinations**, **prompt injection** and **priming** and variety of **Tools** integration for enhancing variety of tasks completion accurately and efficiently.
- The project leverages LLM's reasoning and capabilities by **50%**, enhancing the multi-agents' ability to understand and complete complex tasks effectively.
