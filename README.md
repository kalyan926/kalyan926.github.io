## üöÄ Projects

### üß† Multiagent AI Assistant
- **Overview**: Built a multi-agent system for intelligent task completion using LANGCHAIN and OpenAI APIs to leverage GPT-4.
- **Specialized Agents**: Implemented three specialized agents:
  - **Task Planner**: Plans and schedules tasks.
  - **Task Executor**: Executes the planned tasks.
  - **Feedback Agent**: Provides feedback and improvements.
- **Integration**: Agents are interconnected to form a graph structure, enabling seamless communication and task execution.
- **Memory and RAG**: Integrated with memory for context storage and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to filter relevant information, preventing hallucinations and priming from irrelevant context.
- **Real-time Tools**: Ensured agents operate based on accurate and current information, enhancing reliability and task quality.
- **Impact**: Leveraged LLM's reasoning capabilities by 50%, significantly enhancing the agents' ability to understand and complete complex tasks.

### ü¶ô Fine Tuning LLAMA2 Using QLORA [(Project link)](https://github.com/kalyan926/FineTuning-using-QLORA)
- **Method**: Fine-tuned the base LLAMA2 using QLORA method with <1% trainable parameters, achieving faster training on limited hardware (single GPU).
- **Quantization**: Quantized the model to 4-bit Normal Float using bitsandbytes library and added LoRA layers using PEFT library.
- **Performance**: Despite quantization and LoRA layers, the model reported only a 10% drop in performance compared to the original full-precision model.

### üåê Translator with Transformer Architecture [(Project link)](https://github.com/kalyan926/Translator)
- **Architecture**: Developed an English to Telugu translator using complete transformer architecture built from scratch with Keras subclassing APIs.
- **Training**: Employed custom training loop and scheduled learning rate for faster convergence. Used kerastuner for hyperparameter selection.
- **Evaluation**: Model's translation quality evaluated using BLEU score.
- **Enhancements**: Multihead attention significantly improved handling of long-term dependencies, contextual representation, and capturing semantic nuances, leading to accurate and contextually rich translations.
